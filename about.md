#### About this app

This app facilitates an illustrative evaluation for the study power when the number of patients completing assessment is fewer than the planned sample size.

This calculation assumes a normal or asymptotically normally distributed endpoint for a pairwise treatment comparison, where there was a hypothesized treatment effect (>0) for which the design has the indicated power to detect.

Please refer to the **Help** tab for the user guide with examples.
